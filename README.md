UVA Hackathon Project

This project was submitted to HooHacks. It links mentors to students who need help in certain subjects. To start, create an account and log in (Google Firebase and Firebase authentication authenticates and stores user information) as a teacher or student.

As a teacher, you can provide help and host google meets. You can also choose what subjects to teach. We use the google-meets api and a Firebase database to keep a realtime track of current meetings and open slots.

As a student, you can pick what subjects you need help with and choose an apropriate meeting.
